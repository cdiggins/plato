# Single linked list.

Requires optional (nullable) types.
* A type reference with a "?" is an optional type. 
* You can assign "null" to it. 
* It may or may not have a value present. 
* Using the value requires a check for null 
	* Maybe this happens automatically
* They cannot be changed. 

type SingleLinkedList<T> 
{
	T Value;
	SingleLinkedList<T>? Next;
}

# Double Linked List

This is trickier. THere is no way to construct a double linked list without modification.
A constructor would look like what? They have a concept of "this". 

type DoubleLinkedList<T>
{
	T Value;
	SingleLinkedList<T>? Previous;
	SingleLinkedList<T>? Next;	
}

library Lists
{
	CreateLinkedList(value: $T, prev: DoubleLinkedList<$T>): DoubleLinkedList<$T>
	{
		var r = new DoubleLinkedList<T>(Value, prev, null);
		return r;
	}

	CreateLinkedList(value: $T, hasNext: Func<$T, bool>, getNext: Func<$T, $T>): DoubleLinkedList<$T>
	{
		repeat 
		{
			var *r = new DoubleLinkedList<T>(value);
			var *next = CreateLinkedList(getNext(value), hasNext prev, null);
			next->Prev = r;
			r->Next = next;
			// NOTE: the above is kind of a lie. next->Prev suggests that it no longer can be modified. BUu
			return r;
		} 
		until (!hasNext(value));
		return r;
	}
}

Perhaps modification is allowed, when we can prove that a value is not used elsewhere. 

Double linked lists have an interesting challenge, because everything has two pointers.
And we have the case where we are actively modifying one, there is going to be an extra pointer. 

# File Reader 

This is a unique type. We don't want to share it. 

# Affine, Unique, Linear 

Modification when we can prove that no-one is sharing a reference is safe. 

Proving that is hard. We have things like double-linked lists, or more complex graphs
where there are potentially lots of references to things. 

What about circular linked list? 

# Simplest thing that Could Possibly Work

Allow pointers. Classes with pointers can not be used in structs. 
They are "dangerous". 

Pointers are not the same as array references. 

I could have an "Array slice" primitive type. This can help for things like 
safe copying of regions and analysis. 

# Unique Types 

What kinds of things can I do when I am only allowed one reference at a time?
Obviously I can have a single linked list. 

Is modifying it possible? I would need a "borrow" mechanism. Where I transfer ownership 

Single linked list has a problem, each node has a reference to next node. This reference 
needs to be "borrowed", to make a modification. 

How would this work? 

Iterating a linked list, would require borrowing. 

I couldn't have two linked-list iterators active at the same time. This makes a number of algorithms
very hard to write. 

# Note from Rust

Can only have one reference to a value when we want to change it. Can't have immutable references. 

In Plato the proposal is that "x?" is an immutable reference. 

# Differences from Rust

In Plato you can't change data once it is "fixed". You can't just make a reference to something and modify it. 

Perhaps only values that are freshly made can be modified, or that are stored as pointer. Once it becomes 
a reference you are done. 

That could help solve several problems. 

	var *r = new DoubleLinkedList<T>(value);
	var *next = CreateLinkedList(getNext(value), hasNext prev, null);
	next->Prev = r;
	r->Next = next;
	// NOTE: the above is kind of a lie. next->Prev is an immutable reference, not a pointer which suggests that it 
	// no longer can be modified. 
	return r;

I could kind of make it work in the following: 

	var *r = new DoubleLinkedList<T>(value);
	var *next = CreateLinkedList(getNext(value), hasNext prev, null);
	(next->Prev, r->nex) = (r, next);
	return r;

I don't trust that entirely. I worry that it could be tweaked. 
However, the cute thing is that once I have it done, it kind of works. 

Now what about the idea of modifiable lists. 

In order for a modifiable list to work, all immutable references have to be removed. 
That is a lot of work. I don't really want to do that ... 

Unless? Maybe there is a special system for borrowing and creating references to mutable types. 

Kind of like Rust.
