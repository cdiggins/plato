To-do:

* Get the list of implemented interfaces 
* Definition (and requirement) of "INumeric" is that every field is INumeric
	* Need to validate that.
* Definition (and requirement) of "IVector" is that it is also an INumeric, and that the elements are "INumeric"
* NOTE: a collection of some INumeric type, should automatically have some operations. 
* Todo: there needs to be a bunch of math functions: Math.Sqrt, Math.Abs, etc. 
	* These need to be extension methods (float/double/int/etc.)
	* Then they have to work on all of the INumeric types themselves as extension methods 
* There are then math functions that make sense on an "IVector" or more specifically, any "IArray<Z>". 
	* Maybe for things like Sum() they could work on an IEnumerable. 
	* What would I get ... "Average", "Sum", "Variance", "StandardDeviation". 
	* PrefixSums, PostfixSums, PartialDifference 
	* Maybe a bit more excel type stuff: Binormal distrubition function, Chisquare, 
	* Frequency/histogram
	* Mode/median 
	* Skew/Kurtosis 
	* Student-T distribution 
	* COrrelation 
	* DotProduct 
* To-do: add the interface chain!!! 
* Given a TypeReference ... how do I figure out the declaration?

How should Unity work with Plato code and vice versa.

I want an animation controller:
* Animation controller allows you to assign arbitrary animation to different fields? 
	* I'll say start the animation now, 
	* Animate(50.Seconds(), 1f, 3f);
	* But how do I track it? 
	* I can't "animate" 
	* I have to run the values through the animation controller, which will provide me with values? 
	* var pos = (Circle(t) * Radius).Animate(50.Seconds(), 1f, 3f);

* That last bit is kind of obvious ... I suppose? But the problem is where is time coming from? 
* There are some systems that come directly from the computer, and I can't really do much about that. 

* FileSystem / Keyboard / Mouse / OS / Network / Debugger / Peripherals / Clock 

* So let's say that the animation only starts when a certain condition is set ...
* And let's say the values of that animation are determined elsewhere. 

	* var t = ??;
	* t *= Controller.AddAnimation(50.Seconds(), 0f, 1f);
	* var pos = (Circle(t) * Radius);

* Now the question is, 

	* var t = ??;
	* curve = Controller.AddAnimation(50.Seconds(), 0f, 1f);
	* var pos = (Circle(t * curve) * Radius);

* This is the easy thing. 

* Not even imperative. 
* the challenge is when I want to do something like create a ripple everytime someone clicks.
* The ripple is a thing. I need to collect the ripple curves. 
* That is a list. The list is mutable.
* Each thing in the list is a kind of influence
* The list is the only affine type I need 
//==

* Maybe I could put the VIM structs in a new namespace, and then just generate everything in another namespace. 
Could that work? 

* The problem is that the usage in functions would be mostly illegal. 
* Maybe I

To-do: 
- With templates all functions have to be defined as extensions.
- The template doesn't allow for much. 
- Well ... technically it does. 
- But the problem is that any function using something else, will fail. This is because in the "template" namespace, things are different. 


- I need to:
	- Infer the "static". Well it is always static, so that is easy.
	- Infer the interfaces. 
	- Does it implement an interface? If so, great then get the interface.
	- Does it implement an 
	- Infer operations
	- Infer composite actions 
	- Infer implicit casts (e.g., ) when only one value, we know that it can to/from that thing.
	- Interface 
	- Functions are made static. 
	- Static function are placed inside the class. 
	- Can a class have a static and non-static with the same name? 


    class AnimatedValue<T>
    {
        Time Time;
        T Value => Function(Time);
        Func<Time, T> Function;
    }

    class Animation<T>
    {
        Func<Time, T> Function;
        T GetValue(Time time) => Function(time);
    }

    public class Mesh
    {
        public IArray<Triangle> Triangles { get; }
        public IArray<Double2> UVs { get; }
        public IArray<Double3> Points { get; }
        public IArray<Int3> Indices { get; }
    }

// 

It's always going to be the same problem. 

I need to compile to have working code.
So ... 

There is part 1: 
* Get the structs and make them valid.
* Part two write the algorithms
* IF I write them as static functions, it is fine ... it just works.  
* If I want to use fluent API in the algorithms, I have to wait for the 
	extension methods to be created. 
* The problem is that those fluent methods are where? 
	I mean if I just write some algorithms, is it going to make a copy of those 
	functions? 
* It's a bit funny, but some of this is just a question of writing it out. 
* The last problem is wrestling with the darn intellisense. 
* Intellisense wants everything to be public / static / compile, etc. 

//==

So what about the interfaces? 
In order to add fun interfaces to the classes, I will have to look for extension methods.
	
//==

Can I do the math operations automatically? 

Does Plato have to be valid C#? Or can I just make it generate. 

After compilation, it will probably all just work. 

The question though is how do I deal with type constraints on numerics. 

I could use a placeholder. 

I don't have to be strict. This is mostly a code generation issue. 
 
I could have a value called "Number" that acts as an implicit place holder. 
Same with Value. 

I could enumerate it Value1, Value2. This implies that they are both values
but different. 

The thing is that operations on generics that are different.

An operation that mixes two different types of numbers is not possible.

Treating an interface like a template argument. 

Some interfaces aren't really interfaces. They are actually 

//==

* I invented concepts.
* It isn't really that useful.
* So the thing is that I need to have interfaces and implementations.
* IArray<T>
* I want to write a Sum() function, so how do I do that?
* So ... I wanto to write some of the algorithms, that are going to be used. 
* IVector ... 

//==

Vector / Number 

* What am I doing? 
* I am defining classes that can be used as a "templates". 
* Do they need to be valid C#? 
	* Maybe. 
* I have decided that Plato is going to be much simpler than C#. 
	* The syntax is tight and small. 
* The thing is that the idea of just predefining all of these extra things is a bit burdensome.
	* HOWEVER ... I don't have time to fix everything. 
	* What I need is for the class templates to just work. 
	* So generate all of the necessary code. 
	* By the way, instead of types, they could just be functions. 
	* That would be interesting. 
* The problem is that I'm getting way too fancy off the bat. 
	* Keep it simple.
	* Look at the structs, generate the core stuff. 
	* Using Roslyn. 
	* The whole thing was a paper tiger.

* I need a "PlatoInput" project.
	* It will have a source file. 
	* I need to restructure all of this stuff. 
	* I need to take it seriously.
	* RIght now I'm confused, and half the stuff isn't used. 
	* People are going to be using this next weekend. 
	* So better get cracking. 

* To do that I will need to:
	* Port the math routines over. 
	* Most should work. 

* So once I have the types, what about the algorithsm. 
	* Where do they live? 
	* I can't just keep adding things to the generator can I? 
	* I need a place to write stuff. 

* The example is:
	* Capsule. 
	* Capsule

* What I find amazing, is that this looks exactly like the visual language I wanted. 

* So we do the structs first. 
* Then we do a pass on the algorithms.

* AlmostEquals
* Epsilon
* Comparison = Gt  :t  
* Measures can be added together 
* CompareTo 
* Measures can be compared
* Clamp 
* Lerp

* Magnitude
* Dot
* MagnitudeSquared
* Sum
* Product
* Compare
* Min
* Max

//==

* Stupid performance hack.
	* Put all of the extension functions in the classes directly 
	* But seriously ... don't do that
	* Just inline at the code site. 
* Do we care about performance
	* Not yet
* The problem:
	* Visual programming mapping to/from 
* I do want:
	* Don't say "public static this" all the freaking time. 
	* Of course it is "public static this", just figure that out. 
* I also want:
	* Express algorithms in terms of concepts. 
	* Express algorithms without supplying the darn type parameters.
	* Type parameters can be implied. 
	* This is an interesting thing. 
* Ultimately, I want to be able to express the entire LinqArray library as a graph.
	* To do this, means the system implies the type signatures.

To make the type system work properly I think I am going to need the type parser to work. 

I would like an interpreter for the thing.

I would like a parser that is not dependent on Roslyn. 

Would be fun, but is a bunch of extra work. Maybe later. 

Right now. 

//==

There are two questions: 
* Can I generate IL code?
* Can I generate C# from the IL code? 
* Should I generate JavaScript at the same time?
* Should I use JavaScript for the other things? 
* Can I simplify the auto-generation of code? Right now there is a lot of string magic. 

* I don't like the fact that so much of the code is just magic. 

//==

Intervals could have things like: "Extent"
I notice virtually every value type could have "Min(a, b)" and "Max(a, b)"
The intrinsics are not necessary
I think each type will need to be in a different file. 

//==

Most of the stuff for intervals will work.

I'm working on how to do "Min" / "Max" in a general way. 
I might need to treat numbers like 1-d vectors. 
The other question is what about a TimeInterval? Or any other unit of measure interval? 
Intervals make sense in a number of cases: I just need to be able to subtract them.

I also need to be able to multiply by a double.

// TODO: how do I implement the Math operations on numbers 
Number Sqrt(Number n) => throw new NotImplementedException();

So the "intrinsics" is kind of important. 

VectorizedOperations is kind of what I want as the fundamental operations. 
The problem is that there is a lot of operations on numbers and stuff.

So basically I can look at the things that are defined on a "Number" and then generalize them.

Do I really need to make it all so pretty? 

==

Okay, so instead of having a "Vectorized" version, I can just define the stuff on numbers? 
But what are the definitions? This "vectorized" approach isn't so bad. 

I think I should call it "Vectorized"

These functions can all be generalized. 

Maybe I could simply define it for a number? 
The interesting thing is that it is not "Vectorized", because it is defined on the compound type ... not the element.
self / Magnitude(self)

Are "measures" numbers? The only thing you don't want to do is multiply them together or divide them. 
They are quantities. An interval is like that. 

A vector does not support comparison. 

An interval can be made of Vectors or Scalars or Measures.

Static functions should also be defined as a non-static functions so that they can be called from the calls.
//==

What I am trying to figure out here:
* How do I deal with errors in the editor.
* I can't fix them all.
* It would be nice ... 
* The part that has me stumped is what to do about types that are computed from other types.
* Like elements of an array or return types of a function.
* I could use a special functon I suppose. You usually just want to declare an array of the thing? 
* Or there are cases where what you want is to declare a concrete type within the implementation. 
* Just saying "Any" is no good, because the constraints are not clear. 
* I mean technically I could solve for it as well. It's just the same type inference as everwhere else.
* Two options:
	* Leave it all in C# for now
	* Leave it with errors in the compiler (no intellisense)
* I find it makes a pretty compelling story: removing all of the boilerplate and inferring the correct types.
	In fact it is pretty darn amazing. 
* So "Any" here gets translated into something concrete. Makes sense. 
* Next step:
	* Parse this with the parser.
	* Convert into the intermediate representation (IR).
	* Convert into literal C# 
	* See how bad it is 
	* Generate the "Concepts"? 
	* Perform the type inference
	*

The conditional access is giving me a strange problem. It produces a "MemberBinding" syntax node.
Which I had never seen prior. This makes life complicated. 

//==

Okay: now that I compiled the thing down into some form, I need to simplify it. 

//==

In order to figure out the types of things, I need to figure out what the names are. To what are they referring. 

Bsaic stuff: just go through the code and figure out where each name is defined. 

Is it a function? Is it a variable? Is it a type?
So I would love this to be a generic algorithm.

So how do I make it easy to do all of those things? 

The "expression" in a sense might just never change. The value returned might. 

The "let binding" is in of itself an expression. 

What about statements. 

How do I represent all of these different forms? 

When we are reducing ... 

What is interesting is that in some of these forms what we are doing is associating an expression with something. 

We aren't just throwing it out ... we are associating it with something. 

That association is kind of important, I think. 

Don't forget that in addition to hte "global" frame, there are namespaces. 
There are also contexts like "class". A class is similar to a namespace.  

When you call a function you: 
1. Create a variable binding for each parameter. 

Note:
* There is a special operation when you return a function: you are creating a closure.

//==

It seems to me that there are any different analyses that can be performed. 

How many different forms do I want to have? 

Does it really make sense to call each one an interpreter. 

It is also a:
* Symbolic executor
* Evaluator
* Abstract interpreter
* Translator
* Reducer

When you think about it, interpreter does make sense.

What language should I use? 
Would it be a better idea to prepare for Python talk?

* Expressive

Can I infer reasonable types for every function? 

Every parameter is assigned an any type? And then it just works. 

//==

September 30th, 

Some of the callable constraints are weird. 

   (Function, $73, $74, $75) is callable with ($72,$343

There needs to be more cast constraints. 
In order to do that I would need to resolve
functions and stuff. 

There is a challenge, if anything can't 
be resolved, almost nothing can be 
resolvved 

When it says: 
   Tuple is callable with ($333,(Function, Integer))

I want a type variable there.

I think this is going to work ... soon. 

//==

October 2nd,

* Do I need to resolve constraints first? 
* Of course. 
* It is all about that ultimately. 
* There can be rules eventually to simplify, like saying once the first type  
* Would it be easier if every constraint had a type variable? 
* I could constraint things to an expression 
* So resolving constraints: 
	* you have a list of possibilities. 
	* remove the impossible ones
	* from ambiguous choices choose the "best"
* Is there a case where choosing the best means another constraint is impossible? 
	* I can't think of anything right now. 
	* So I should assume the worst.
* One rule of thumb is to find a solution that works, is simple, and is slow. 
* I did want to separate out the choices ... so that I could determine what each 
	function was from the groups, without looking at other things. 
	Otherwise the logic becomes too complicated. 
	I have N types, known, what is the function. 
* The problem is that one of the input types might not be a known type, just a type
	variable with a constraint. So what do I do then? I won't be able to resolve 
	the function type until the type variable is resolved. 
	With a type-variable we can usually determine a list of constraints though,
	which come close to describing the type. 
	This does confuse things a bit because there are two types of constraints. 
	So we have known types, and we have type variables with implements constraints. 
	Given that ... we should be able to resolve every function type.
	Only one way to know. Experiment. 
* So what does this experiment look like? 
	* And by the way, shouldn't it just be a question: of all the types I can choose from 
	does this work? 
	* No not quite, we want to find the function that fits best. 
	* A little ambiguity is okay. 
* So find all constraints on a type-variable.
* When calling a function we are going to get a number of possible functions. 
	* Depending on which function is chosen, it creates a different set of constraints.
	* So function calling, creates a constraint tree. 
	* We want to at least narrow it down. 
	* Once we get the result types 
* Previously I had the idea of modeling the constraint tree directly. So what if it might get big?
	* At least I can look at it, and debug it properly. 
	* So we say "IConstraintSet", OneOf()

//==

* There is mismatch in the number of arguments. Nothing matches! 
* That is very odd.
* Fixed the problem.
* Now facing lots of ambiguity. 
* I want to remove the ambiguity.
* I could address the fact 

//==

Negative(self) with ((Arithmetic)) has 3 possible return types Number, Integer, (Arithmetic)

Max(x) with ($101) has 2 possible return types $7, DateTime

concept Interval<T: Numerical>
    inherits Vector<T>
{
    Min(x: Self): T;
    Max(x: Self): T;
}

Actually, this is a problem: the whole (Min/Max) interval thing isn't particular well thought out. 
Sometimes I have an A/B, sometimes Min/Max. 

The thing about concept functions, is that they always have a concrete type when executed. 
However, they might occur within a function that uses a concept type as a parameter. 

Right now the other problem is $7, has an unclear meaning. What it means is that the type passed in has to be of
form A<B> and $7 is the B. 

So I need the Min(x: Self) to become: Min(A<B>) => B. 

In other words every function need to become a type generator function. 

//==

Steps: rewrite the "Self" types in functions to become the concept itself. But ... that isn't one hundred percent accurate. 
Becoming a type variable with a constraint: $6 :: Interval<$7> might make more sense. 

Remember there seems to be a separate meaning of constraint. In the sense of what a type variable must implement. 

An "implements" constraint. 

Given the list of type-variables and stuff, it should be enought to determine the type. 

//==

IMPORTANT:

* I need to solve the problem of giving a function, determine what its return type is given its inputs. 
This is non-trivial, but it is possible. It is different from everything else. 

* Next: what is the best fit function.

* I believe that this involves unifying complex functions. 

//==

* I have observed that whatever you pass as the first type of an "Add" function, is going to be the output type. 
* How can I determine that in a consistent way? 
* There is a most general definition of the function ... 

For every function I can try to figure out the list of possibilities that are of the same type. 

Is there going to be a "most general"? Not necessarily. It would be the one that is lowest on the poll. 

So let's say we have four possibilities. 

Add(self, Negative(self)) with ((Arithmetic), $320) has 4 possible return types Number, Integer, (Arithmetic), (ScalarArithmetic)

We know it is going to be (Arithmetic)

So Arithmetic and ScalarArithmetic are both valid options. Number supports both Arithmetic and ScalarArithmetic. 

If passing a concept you choose first the ones that are the best fit. Closest

//==

I think Type variables need to have constraints stored in them: what.
