User-authorized optimizer exploration. Contract revision O1: dedicated agent, isolated experiment, critical review, execution plan, and a bounded first implementation. Shared compiler changes require supervisor ownership approval.

## Done means

- [x] Elaborate the opportunity against current source and existing proposals.
- [x] Run a reproducible experiment with correctness checks and record limitations.
- [x] Critically review legality, benefit, and implementation risks.
- [x] Write an ordered execution plan and execute its first bounded step.
- [x] Review and commit deliverables; distinguish prototype evidence from production integration.

- [x] Execute the actual Plato TIR fixture milestone and record the bounded production integration decision.
- [ ] Implement and test the planned read-only producer/alias fact adapter on representative callers before any bounds or length rewrite.

## Production continuation â€” 2026-10-25

The committed secondary census identifies completed loop results, TirTempRef and local aliases in actual Plato TIR. It demonstrates why owned length facts need resolved producer/alias provenance and why foreign collection facts must be refused. No bounds or count rewrite was added.

Evidence: [production report](../../docs/reports/optimizer-production-2026-10-25.md) and [secondary TIR census](../../docs/reports/optimizer-secondary-tir-2026-10-25.md). The remaining checkbox is the next execution-plan gate; this item is not closed by fixture evidence alone.
